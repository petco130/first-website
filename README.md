# first-website
Making a website for the first time by myself, leveraging React.js

1/14
Learned some things:
1. React CLI is useful, but if you want to build your own scaffolding, then you only really need a package manager and a folder to put it in
2. Quick start: set up a project using the CLI. Next, you'll want to figure out what your back end looks like. Lay out the components and figure out what components you'll need. Create all the components and make sure they lay out nicely, also make sure any extra styling (bootstrap/etc) is involved.
3. Connecting data may be harder, but for the sake of your first project, maybe make that a secondary goal.

This is going to be not nearly as fun, but it'll be useful, like building your own house. Keep that in mind as you go on.
